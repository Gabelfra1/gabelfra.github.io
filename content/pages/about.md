My journey into the world of data began with a Bachelor's and Master's in Statistics in Bologna.After a couple of years working in an IT company in Italy, I made the move to London in 2020, right in the middle of the pandemic. Since then, I've been applying my skills across various fintechs and now as a Senior Data Scientist at a bank.

When I'm not immersed in data, you'll most likely find me probably in the kitchen or at a pub. As this blog will quickly reveal, cooking is a passion of mine. Beyond the culinary obessesion, my life outside of work often revolves around a table â€“ whether it's sharing a home-cooked meal, strategizing over a board game, or enjoying a good glass of wine with friends.
